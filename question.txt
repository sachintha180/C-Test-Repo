The user must be prompted inputs to populate a dynamic array of (n) vehicles. Assuming only even numbers are allowed, half of the array must be cars, and the rest motorcycles.

The user must then be given the opportunity to resize the dynamic array, to add one more object of their choice - either a motorcycle or car. 

Each object in the dynamic array must be then copied to a static array of unions - each of which contain pointers to "node" unions, which contain a reference to the object from earlier
